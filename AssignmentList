Create a yahtzee game (a five dice game). The game is normally played:

Roll the five dice
Determine which dice to continue rolling
You can roll up to 3 times.

Your goal is to fill out the score card, including:
groups of 1-6's
poker hands such as:
     short straight
     long straight
     full house
     three of a kind
     four of a kind
     yahtzee (5 of a kind)
     chance (whatever is on the dice)

Timeing/Shapes
Use setTimeout and setInterval (any way you like) to move a shape within another
shape - knock yourself out! have fun!

And look at my files for some examples (but that is what i did!):
