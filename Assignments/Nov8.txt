Cracking the code

Coding – Fall 2017

functions in JavaScript

Functions have three main parts in the definition – a name, a set of parameters, and a return. This is like a black box – with a name – you dump some stuff in, something happens, and something comes out.

And functions allow you to code something one time, and then call it whenever you need to do it…

For example, I am writing code to model a car. One of the things I need to model is checking air in the tires. And I do that every 20 miles. So I write:

function checkAir(tireNum){

hold hose next to valve;

take off top from valve;

connect hose to valve;

while (not full){

press hose towards valve;

}

}

Then I can write a loop to fill my tires:

//remember – check the spare tire

function checkAllTires(){

for (int i=0; i<5; i++){

checkAir(i);

}

}

Or, if there was a flopping noise coming from one place I could simply write:

checkAir(3);

Now, whenever you are someplace where you need to check the air in your tires, you can simply call the functions checkAllTires() - and presto! Done!

Try it.

Try writing a function for the following scenarios:

1) Washing dishes: maybe you end up with a statement like –

stateOfDishes = washDishes(plates, cups)

in other words, a return!

2) Cooking scrambled eggs

3) juggling 3 balls

4) calculating any positive integer power of any positive integer.

Now lets take the time to write some real functions – write them and run them and get them to work.

1) Please write an HTML page with:

all necessary tags

a button

a div

that kicks off a function

That function kicks off another function. This second function comes from this list following:

* To find the power of a number:

- 2 parameters

* To determine which variable of 2 is the highest numeric value

* To fire an alert box. But make sure you can determine the value in the box at the time of the function call (rather at the time of the function execution.

* To find the average of 5 different numbers. (parameters)

* To determine of some variable is positive or negative

* To write “This is oh so very cool” in a div.

* To change the color of the div

* To change the text in the div
