<h3>a bit of CSS here</h3>

<p>This is the first paragraph... and we are doing all kinds of 
yada yada sorts of other yada yada sort of kind of things that
we don't really understand very well</p>

<p>And this is the second paragraph.... adn we are sort of kind
of doing all kinds of second paragraph sorts of things... that
we also don't understand very well, but we think we understand
the second paragraph sorts of things better than the first 
paragraph sorts of things.
</p>

<p>And this is the third - but only one line</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mr Krug, FRCS computers and stuff</p>
