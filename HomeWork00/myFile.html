<p>Dear Mom,
<p>Thanks so much for being my mom.

<p>It really helps.

<p><font color=red face='Laksaman' size=12><u>Mr Krug</u></font> is having us write a thank-you
notes to our parents. He thinks this is a very
good idea. <p>And it is.</p><p>We will be learning
about HTML and browswers while we are
actively <u><i>appreciating our parents</i></u>.

<p>So,<font color=pink>I</font> want you to know - that <font color=pink>I</font> am loving
this class so much! Mr Krug is really quite
awesome!
And
very, very
cool. 
<p>And I know it is all because of you - that 
I have this fantastic opportunity to learn
this stuff.

<p>Thanks so so much!
<p>Love,
<p>~Me</p>
