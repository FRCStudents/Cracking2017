Dear Mom,

Thanks so much for being my mom.

It really helps.

Mr Krug is having us write a thank-you
to our parents. He thinks this is a very
good idea. This was, we will be learning
about HTML and browswers while we are
actively appreciating our parents.

So, I want you to know - that I am loving
this class so much! Mr Krug is really quite
awesome!

And I know it is all because of you - that 
I have this fantastic opportunity to learn
this stuff.

Thanks so so much!
Love,
~Me
