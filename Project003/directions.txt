Assignment: Mix/Max...

1) Create a web page with 2 text entry fields, and 3 buttons, and one
div for a return string.

2) Each entry field will accept a number - and convert it to an integer.

3) The first button is called Max. It will access a function called "max(x,y)"
This function will accept 2 parameters and return the maximum int value. For
example - if one wrote and executed: var y = max(5,3); then the var y would
have the value of 5. On the other hand, if one executed: var y = min(5,3); then
the value y would have the value of 3.

If one executes var y = equals(4,5); then y would have the string value "No equal".
If, on the other hand, one executes var y = equals(4,4); then y would have
the string value "equal".

Good Luck!
