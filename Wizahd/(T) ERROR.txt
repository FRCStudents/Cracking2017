The movie starts with a normal dad. He is working for someone and the public isn't supposed to know he does. He has a small child, he acts like a normal dad. They have
a dog too. He is an FBI informant. They called him to do something in Pittisburgh, he needs the money. He's going to give it all to his son. He didn't manage his money
well. He agreed to allow filmakers to document certain parts of the investigation. He shows a map on the wall of people that are from Islam and Afghanistan, he says 
"If you're making Islam look bad, you gotta go." They have recruited bad people, they used to just investigate after crimes have been commited. The FBI ask him to meet 
at a cafe. He looks at pictures of the POI, person of interest. They believe this guy is involved with people who are involved in terrorism reactions. He met them 
randomly, talking, they had exchanged numbers and other personal information. They are supposed to be students connected to terrorist groups. He did time. Most of the
time they have them get close to targets. The agents are a bit slow, not used to domestic terrorists. He then is creating cupcakes, calling himself a master baker.
He is himself around his targets. The next scene is the black panther revolts, this guy joined the black panthers during the spring time. The black panthers represent
the worst threat to america from the inside. The FBI had them under servailence. All of his POIs are muslims. He doesn't particularly care why. He is struggling with
his faith. He went to the place his POI was going to.
