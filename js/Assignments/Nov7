Coding:
We tried to write calculator. We are trying to understand functions – parameters being passed, and how functions work. And with all that, we are trying to get some idea of how to design a program. 

It’s not easy. Like every other design process – I recommend that you start by grabbing a drink and laying down somewhere you can watch the clouds… and imagine. And let your mind drift. That is the beginning of many good designs.

Now we are going to try writing some simple functions – grab an HTML file with a button that fires off a javascript function:

Now write:

1) a function that takes one parameter and displays it in the console (and then alert box)
2) a function that takes two parameters and adds them together
3) a function that takes two parameters and concatenates them
4) a function that takes three parameters (as the sides of a cube) and determines the volume
5) a function that takes one parameter and returns True if the parameter is even
6) write a function that uses the function in question 5 above.
