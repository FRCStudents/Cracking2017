doDir2.py: the python file to process the emails

www.efraimkrug.site/General/send.html		web page (form)

	This web page presents a form. When the user
	fills the form and presses "submit" his/her 
	email engine comes up, ready to sent the email
	in question to ekrug@foxboroughrcs.org

	Once the email is sent, someone goes to the
	email inbox, reads the email, right clicks
	on the emails and saves it as a text file
	in the correct directory.

	~/FRCS2017/Cracking/python/EmailProcess/?.txt

	Then, I go to that directory, and kick off:
	python3 doDir2.py

	This program runs, identifying all the .txt files
	in our directory, and extracting the necessary
	information. We then print out the info.

	(python3 doDir2.py > out) also works... I'm just
	saying!

	Note - the file is organized user X user, but there
	is not other organization to the folder!
