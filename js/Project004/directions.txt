Assignment: swap...

1) Create a web page with 2 text entry fields, and 1 button.

2) Each entry field will accept a string.

3) The button is called "Swap". When one clicks the button,
the values in the 2 entry fields are exchanged. For example:
If I enter "This" in the first text field, and "That" in the
second field - if I press the Swap button, the values are
exchanged so that the first text field now has "That" and the
second text field has "This".

Good Luck!
