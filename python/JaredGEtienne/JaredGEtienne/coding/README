Hi Jared...

Some of your code is broken... 

If there are questions you are giving up on, please
let me know!

It's very different to be 'tired of working' on a 
problem... and therefore you ask for help... and
'i think it works'... and therefore you turn it in!

Either one is ok... just clarify what you want!
