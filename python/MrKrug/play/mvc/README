** MVC - Model-View-Controller		  **
** This is a simple example of separating **
** code into an organization. This MVC    **
** organization is very common, in many   **
** languages. The idea is there are 3     **
** functional components.                 **
** M (Model) - is the database access.    **
** V (View) - is the front end - that is  **
**		the user's view           **
** C (Controller) - is the connecting     **
** 		code - that connects      **
**		the other two parts       **
********************************************

In this project, the model feeds records
to the controller/view. These records come
from files (db2.txt). This file is a text
file with JSON encoded records.

This is the simplest version of this project.
The user fires the controller.start routine.
The controller than fires up the first view,
and initializes an array with the model 
(by reading the db2.txt file)

We never write the file. You can ask to see
everyone in the database one time, the names
get listed and the program is over.
