** MVC - Model-View-Controller		  **
** This is a simple example of separating **
** code into an organization. This MVC    **
** organization is very common, in many   **
** languages. The idea is there are 3     **
** functional components.                 **
** M (Model) - is the database access.    **
** V (View) - is the front end - that is  **
**		the user's view           **
** C (Controller) - is the connecting     **
** 		code - that connects      **
**		the other two parts       **

In this project, the model feeds records
to the controller/view. These records come
from files (db2.txt). This file is a text
file with JSON encoded records.

The file is read when the model starts, and
the file is written when the user presses
'e' to end the program.
