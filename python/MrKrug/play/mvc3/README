** MVC - Model-View-Controller		  **
** This is a simple example of separating **
** code into an organization. This MVC    **
** organization is very common, in many   **
** languages. The idea is there are 3     **
** functional components.                 **
** M (Model) - is the database access.    **
** V (View) - is the front end - that is  **
**		the user's view           **
** C (Controller) - is the connecting     **
** 		code - that connects      **
**		the other two parts       **

This mvc3 is an MVC application (simple, as it is)
that has a view - a command line menu/prompt system,
and a model - a sqlite3 database single-table database,
and a controller - balancing delicately between the 
two. 

there are no routes... there is no http interface.
