Step 01: Go onto pythonanywhere

Step 02: Create a directory and clone our repo...
	a) mkdir code        
	b) git clone https://github.com/FRCStudents/Cracking2017.git
	c) git config --global 	user.name "your name"
	d) git config --global  user.email "email@address"

Step 03:
	Start up python
	$ python3.5
	>>>>

Step 04:
	try to create some variables -
	What is a variable name?
	Can it start with a number?
	Can it be a whole word?
	Can it have numbers in it?
	What about puctuation?
	 
Step 05:
	try to create a function
	* mult(x,y)
	* add(x,y)
	* def mult (x, y):
		return x * y
	* then use mult
	* mult(3,6)
	* write add(x,y) and sub(x,y) and div(x,y) and mod(x,y)
	
Step 06:
	let's play with loops
	* range(5)
	* for x in range(5):
		print(x)
	

Step 07:
	what about a loop with an array?
	* x = [1,2,3,4]
	* for y in x:
		print(y)
