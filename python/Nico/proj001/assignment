In this assignment, you are working on coding 
a string of characters, or a message.

The idea is an ancient coding technique - transposing
each letter in the message to the next one in the
alphabet (a becames b, b becomes c etc)

In this way, "apple" becomes "bqqmf"

The assignment is for you to write a loop that:
	1) accepts a string from the user
	2) accepts a key from the user
	3) transposes the first string based on the key

	The key is simply an int that tells the code
	how many letters to move. 

	e.g. if the key is 3, then 'a' becomes 'd'
	     if the key is 4, then 'a' becomes 'e', etc 

	4) the loop will then display the new string, and
	start over - accepting a string from the user

	5) you may ask the user if they want to quit with
	each iteration.

good luck!
