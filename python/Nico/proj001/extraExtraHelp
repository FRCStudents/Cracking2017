4)      Display the character after the character in 
        the string - that is - if the string is "ab" 
        you display "bc"
                * if you need extra,extra help - see
                the extraExtraHelp file

There are two ways to identify the 'next char' - one is
in data, and one is functional.

For example, if I want to use the 'data' approach, I can
create another array with the alphabet, find the letter
I have, add my offset to the index, and retrieve that 
offset letter.

alpha = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

i have a string "apple" and an offset-key 3.

Steps:
	examine the first letter ("a")
	find "a" in my alphabet array: index = 0
	add my offset to the index (0 + 3 = 3)
	and return the value in that offset position
	alpha[3] which is 'd'

note: 
	1) there is a find function on a string you can 
	use like this:

		a = "haPPyisTHEman"
		i = a.find('y')
		print(i)	<-- prints 4 because a[4] is the 
				first occurrence of 'y'

	2) there is a lower function on a string you can
	use like this:
		s = a.lower()
		print(s[2]) 	<== prints 'p' (lower case)
