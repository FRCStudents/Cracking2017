Question 1 to think about:
        Given any letter in the alphabet, how can I
	determine the letter that comes after that?
	What do I do with 'z'? 

Question 2 to think about:
	How can I determine the letter that comes 
	i places after the first letter - if i is
	an int variable?

Question 3 to think about:
	Are there any boundaries on i?

===================================================

You can figure out how to do all the following
steps in the interpreter.

As you get each step working - you can put the
code into a script and keep it.

1)	Write code to accept a string from a user
	* Can you prompt the user for the string?

2)	Display that string

3) 	Display that string character by character
		* this should be in a loop

4)	Display the character after the character in 
	the string - that is - if the string is "ab" 
	you display "bc"
		* if you need extra,extra help - see
		the extraExtraHelp file

5)	Write a function to display step 4 above

6)	The function takes an int parameter

7)	Now change the function so it uses the parameter
	as the offset.

8)	Put it together:
		Accept the string
		Accept the offset
		Display the string
		Display the offset string
