pieces and concepts:
1) while loop
	* while (x is true):
		do something
		if (something):
			x = false

2) input()
	x = input()
	y = input("Enter something")


3) strings are letters strung together
   ints are numbers
   you can not treat a string like an int
   x = int('1')

4) string has a find method
	s = "this"
	x = s.find('i')
	x is now equal to 2

5) append adds something on to the string
   x = 'this'
   x.append('Yo')
   x is now equal to 'thisYo'

6) Turning an array into a string... 
	an array is treated like separate items.
	a string is like one item made up of
	separate items.

	* separator = '-'
	* arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']
	* y = separator.join(arr)
	* y is now equal to "a-b-c"
