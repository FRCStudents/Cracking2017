For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friend’s birthdays are, 
and be able to find that information based on their name. Create a 
dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program 
it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that 
person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:

>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706...


This exercise is Part 2 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. 
The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 3, and Part 4.

In the previous exercise we created a dictionary of famous scientists’ 
birthdays. In this exercise, modify your program from Part 1 to load 
the birthday dictionary from a JSON file on disk, rather than having 
the dictionary defined in the program.

Bonus: Ask the user for another scientist’s name and birthday to add 
To the dictionary, and update the JSON file you have on disk with the 
scientist’s name. If you run the program multiple times and keep adding 
new names, your JSON file should keep getting bigger and bigger.
